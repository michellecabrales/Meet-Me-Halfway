This project will be a GPS app of sorts that allows users to find the best location halfway between them to meet up at.

###
We want to use React and nodejs to code this, for the frontend and backend respectively. 
Google Maps and React have some APIs we can draw from to use. 
If we can't use google maps we have alternatives to select from.
